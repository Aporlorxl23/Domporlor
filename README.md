Domporlor is a subdomain discovery tool that discovers valid subdomains for websites by using passive online sources. It has a simple modular architecture and is optimized for speed. Domporlor is built for doing one thing only - passive subdomain enumeration, and it does that very well.

We have designed Domporlor to comply with all passive sources licenses, and usage restrictions, as well as maintained a consistently passive model to make it useful to both penetration testers and bug bounty hunters alike.
